				<h2>&quot;It's a destruction of life&quot;</h2>
				<p><em>Part 1: A return to hostilities </em></p>
				
				<p>On the night of 15 December 2013, shooting broke out between groups within the Sudan People’s Liberation Army, the national army of the Republic of South Sudan. Accounts of precisely what triggered the violence vary but what is clear is that fighting involving troops loyal to President Salva Kiir Mayardit and those backing sacked vice president Riek Machar spread quickly across the capital, Juba, and the rest of the country. Civilians were targeted because of their ethnic group – Kiir is Dinka; Machar Nuer - and were killed in large numbers.</p>
 
				<p>The auxiliary bishop of Juba, Right Reverend Santo Loku Pio, heard much of the first night’s fighting from the balcony of his home. Over the next few days, some 7,000 people turned up at the compound of Juba Cathedral to seek refuge.</p>
 
				<p>Many more sought the protection of UN peacekeepers in their military base in Juba. One of them, 34-year-old Tol, said he managed to escape a massacre of fellow Nuer by playing dead among their corpses.</p>
 
				<p>Civilian atrocities also took place amid battles for the control of Bor, which lies 160 kilometres north of Juba on the river Nile. Witnesses said forces loyal to Machar committed mass killings, sexual violence and other war crimes. Tens of thousands of civilians fled to the village of Mingakaman, on the other side of the Nile.</p>
 
				<p>By the end of January, almost 650,000 people had been displaced within South Sudan, with a further 123,000 people having fled to neighbouring countries.</p>
 
				<p>A cessation of hostilities agreement was signed on 23 January and led to a significant reduction in fighting, although sporadic clashes have since continued in some areas.</p>

				<h2>&quot;A power struggle within the ruling party&quot;</h2>
			<p><em>Part 2 - How did we get here?</em></p>
				<p>Although  widely portrayed as a &ldquo;tribal conflict&rdquo; between South Sudan&rsquo;s largest  communities, the Dinka and Nuer, the violence that broke out in mid-December is  in fact the culmination of a long-simmering power struggle between different  people and groups within the ruling Sudan People&rsquo;s Liberation Movement/Army.</p>
<p>Rivalry  between Kiir and Machar dates back many years and it was a gesture towards  national unity rather than political amity that led the former to appoint the  latter vice president upon South Sudan&rsquo;s independence in 2011.</p>
<p>Divisions  became ever more apparent in 2013. In June, the president watered down Machar&rsquo;s  vice presidential powers; the following month, he sacked him. </p>
<p>On 6  December opposition elements held a joint press conference to denounce Kiir&rsquo;s  leadership. </p>
<p>The  fighting broke out nine days later, as the ruling party&rsquo;s highest  decision-making body was meeting in Juba.</p>
<p>These and  other divisions within South Sudan were less apparent during the decades of  armed struggle against Khartoum for self-determination. Since then, and in particular since independence, the country and the state has had to be constructed  virtually from scratch. Many in South Sudan expected more from this process,  more from the state in terms of services and representation, than have actually  materialized.</p>
<p>The current clashes are not the first bout of violence  to break out since the end of the civil war. That numerous atrocities have been  committed over the years with impunity, with no justice for victims, no  prosecution of perpetrators, has facilitated the latest recourse to arms in the  face of political deadlock.</p>

				<h2>&quot;We have a lot of work to do&quot;</h2>
			
				<p><em>Part 3 - What next? </em></p>
				<p>The memories of previous  armed conflicts are still fresh in the minds of the adult population of South  Sudan. This current bout of hostilities has set the country&rsquo;s development back  by ten years, according to&nbsp;UN human rights official  Ivan&nbsp;Šimonović.&nbsp;Up to 10,000 people are estimated to have died in the  conflict's first month. The killing of civilians on both sides has instilled  fear and set communities against one another;&nbsp;families have been torn apart.  The young nation&rsquo;s emerging social cohesion has been all but lost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  In camps for the hundreds of thousands of internally displaced, civilians are  angry or afraid - often both. Feeling safe enough to return home is a distant  prospect. Right Reverand Santos Loku Pio still has 500&nbsp;displaced people  camping in and around his cathedral, many of them women and children. &ldquo;What is  going to happen with these children tomorrow? They are going to grow up with  this, and they are going to&nbsp;revenge, which means we have a lot of work to  do.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  Peace processes in South Sudan have consistently promoted stability at the cost  of accountability, offering amnesty deals and high-ranking positions to rebel  leaders. Today's crisis could present an&nbsp;opportunity to change that. The  wheels are already in motion for justice mechanisms that will attempt to bring  those responsible to account.</p>
